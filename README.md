Greetings! 

I served as a research intern at the esteemed Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay, delving into the intricacies of Python-based Planetary Motion Modelling. Within this repository, you'll find an anthology of Python programs I've crafted to explore the language's computational capabilities. These programs span fundamental simulations, including projectile motion, collisions, culminating in my final project: a meticulously scaled 3D dynamic model portraying our Solar System.
