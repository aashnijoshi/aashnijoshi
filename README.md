# hey, i'm Aashni ⚡️

cs + astrophysics @ uc berkeley  
building at the intersection of ai, devtools, and human systems

---

## what i'm working on

**axion**  
ai copilot for developer relations  
→ automates technical content  
→ tracks business impact  
→ helps solo devrel + small teams scale without losing their voice  

**hyperspell**  
early-stage ai infrastructure startup  
head of developer relations / growth  
→ agent memory, live context, rag pipelines  
→ working directly with early customers + founders  

**research & applied work**
- nasa ames — in-space assembly & manufacturing feasibility
- applied ml, data pipelines, and product experiments
- lots of shipping, lots of iteration

---

## things i care about

- building tools people actually use  
- clear thinking over noise  
- systems > motivation  
- technical accuracy + human tone  
- shipping early, learning fast

---

## tech i use

**languages**
- python
- java

**frameworks & tools**
- react
- flask
- llms + rag systems

**other**
- product strategy
- devrel & community
- early-stage growth
- technical writing

## how i work

- i like small, shippable pieces  
- i think in systems and feedback loops  
- i care a lot about clarity — in code, writing, and products  
- i learn by building in public  

---

## currently learning

- better agent architectures  
- evaluation for llm systems  
- product sense for devtools  
- how humans form habits (and break them)

---

## connect

- if you're building devtools
- if you're early-stage and need hands-on help
- if you like thoughtful, slightly chaotic builders
