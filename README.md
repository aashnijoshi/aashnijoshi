Greetings, fellow profile-viewer!

I, Aashni Joshi, am currently a research intern at the Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay. My research relates to Modelling of Planetary Motion, which I plan to do using python. This account is  a collection of python programs I coded in order to better understand python as a computing language as well as to learn how to successfully model the planets I was talking about on python. 

You can contact me @ aashnijoshi@gmail.com/ +91 9819877788

Ciao!
